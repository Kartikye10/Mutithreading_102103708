# Mutithreading_102103708
This assignment demonstrates matrix multiplication using multithreading in Python.
## Problem Statement
The task is to multiply 100 random matrices of size 1000x1000 with a constant matrix of the same size using multithreading.
## Multithreading
Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks within the same process. Threads share the same memory space and can run independently, leveraging multiple CPU cores for parallel computation.
